## Prologue.

As I write this my body’s going numb and I’m afraid no one will remember me. 

There are things in this world I thought I could control but found I could not. There are other stories far more interesting than my own that have died on the lips of countless and been lost. I know this. But still I yearn to be heard, if only for a little while longer. I do not know why I fear to join those before me. But I do.

So I will write, as this last light dies. My name is Ceili. I never had a last name. But you can call me Red.
